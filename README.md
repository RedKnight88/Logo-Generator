# Logo-Generator

## Description

Need a logo? Pesky designers definitely charging too much for creative labor that coders definitely would be able to replicate with automation? Boy, do I have the handy little tool for you!

In all seriousness, SVGs are a fun and unique challenge to program and implement, and they can help generate ideas for more polished graphics. This program helps engage the creative flow by generating some logos with user input through the command line. This project challenged me to utilize paradigms for more advanced code in Object-Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development. Furthering my knowledge of NodeJS, this program also uses Jest for test suites. I learned a lot about how to tackle projects in a structured way, through pseudocode and diagrams, before diving in. All in all, I'm happy with how this turned out, and feel confident with errors, tests, and class structures because of it.

## Installation
This program uses a few different applications. Git Bash, NodeJS, and the Inquirer package within NodeJS. Once those are installed, download this repository.

## Usage
[Walkthrough Video](https://youtu.be/UcWbsejf59E)

This application is very straight-forward and easy to use. When in the project folder in the command line, use "node index.js" as a command to begin. After this, input text after the prompts or choose from a list using the arrow keys and the enter button. The logo file will be added to the folder when finished.

Be aware, using the program again will overwrite any files of the same name "logo.svg" in that folder, so be sure to save a copy of each logo you make before starting again.

## Contributions
If you wish to contribute to this project, please include this simple statement below with any non-trivial patches. 

`I dedicate any and all copyright interest in this software to the public domain. I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors.

## Testing

Testing requires the dev dependency package jest for NodeJS. Installing this, configuring the test files (with the structure 'something.test.js' in the lib path) and running the command 'npm test' should allow you to test the program. When attempting to create improvements or new implementations, these tests will ensure the file is still maintaining its prior functionality.
